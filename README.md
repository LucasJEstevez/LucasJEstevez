Hi, I'm Lucas. I'm currently a fourth-year student at UCCS (expected December 2025). I've taken classes to learn programming concepts, and fluency in Java, C, C++, Bash, Unix, RISC-V Assembly, and more.
Feel free to poke through any of my public repos.

My biggest finished projects on here are under the repos "CS3300-Semester-Project", and "CS3110-GrocLog". CS3300 was a group semester project between myself and three teammates, creating an open-source car-selling platform, think cars.com or cargurus. CS3110 was a partner project to create a web-app that users could use to track their grocery spending and individual grocery prices through time.

At the moment, I'm working on GrocLog, a web-based application that allows the user to keep track of their own grocery spending. It's still in the early stages right now but feel free to take a look! The project is under CS3110-GrocLog

Please reach out! Looking for work!
