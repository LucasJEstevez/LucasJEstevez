Hi, I'm Lucas. I'm currently a third-year student at UCCS (expected May 2026). I've taken classes to learn programming concepts, and fluency in Java, C, C++, Bash, Unix, RISC-V Assembly, and more.
Feel free to poke through any of my public repos.

My biggest finished project on here is under the repo "CS3300-Semester-Project". It was a group semester project between myself and three teammates, creating an open-source car-selling platform, think cars.com or cargurus.

At the moment, I'm working on GrocLog, a web-based application that allows the user to keep track of their own grocery spending. It's still in the early stages right now but feel free to take a look! The project is under CS3110-GrocLog

Please reach out! Looking for work!
